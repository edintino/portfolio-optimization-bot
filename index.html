            <h2>What is Portfolio Optimization?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Portfolio Optimization</strong> is the process of selecting the best distribution of assets (like stocks) to maximize returns while minimizing risk. It's like finding the perfect recipe where you balance ingredients to get the best taste.

                In investing, this involves choosing how much money to allocate to each stock in your portfolio to achieve your financial goals, considering factors like expected returns and volatility (how much the stock price fluctuates).
